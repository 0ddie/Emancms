# Emancms
Open source energy management system using wifi and emoncms[1]. The wifi module we recommend and we will be orginally implementing this system on is the Spark Core[2]. End goals for the project include:
-Having a booking system to book heating or other IOT controlled objects eg lights.
-Having a visual interpretation to show the public the efficiency or inefficiency of a energy system.
-Have that visual interpretation in 3 different levels of complexity for children, non-science orientented adults and science oriented adults.
-The whole system must be secure.
-The system must be adaptable to mutliple client communication types (For example low powered radio).
-The system to be relatively easy to set up.
